   streaming facility is able to save user defined object as well as
   library ones. What you need to do is to simply define how to save
   the state and retrive it from a stream by defing the
   <See Method=TGraphicObject@CreateFromStream> and
   <See Method=TGraphicObject@SaveToStream>. After that you have to

   by the library.

   and then use this index to obtain the <I=class reference> to create
   the object when it must be loaded.

   convert drawing created with old version of the library without
   need to create an explicit version converter.

   you have only to save you own datas if you need by using simply
   <I=Read> and <I=Write> method of <I=TStream>.

  {: A <I=2D graphic object> is a graphic object that is defined on
     a 2D plane.

     The 2D object is defined in a special coordinate system referred
     here as the <I=model coordinate system or model system>. When an object is used by the
     library, the world coordinate system (or world system) are
     needed instead. So the object in model system is transformed by an
     matrix transform to obtain the object in the world system.
     This transform is called the <See Property=TObject2D@ModelTransform>.
     So when an object is drawed, for example, its points are first
     transformed from model system to world system by using this matrix,
     then the view transform (that the concatenation of the
     projection matrix with the mapping matrix) tranform these points
     to obtain the points in the screen system that are easily displayed.

     The 2D object has a 2D bounding box, that is the smallest
     axis aligned rectangle that fully contains the object.
     This rectangle is always in the world coordinate system.
     The bounding box must be computed in the
     <See Property=TGraphicObject@_UpdateExtension> method that have
     to be redefined.

     The model matrix is split in two parts. The first one, called
     the <I=current model matrix>, can be removed at any time or
     can be post multiplied with a new one.

     The second one, called the <I=saved model matrix>, is stored
     permanently inside the object and can only be removed
     by using the <See Method=TObject2D@RemoveTransform> method
     or substituted with the actual model matrix with the
     <See Method=TObject2D@ApplyTransform> method.
     The actual model matrix is the concatenation of the
     <I=saved model matrix> with the <I=current model matrix> in
     this order (remember that the order of concatenation of transform matrix
     is important).

     The presence of the <I=current model matrix> is helpfull to
     create operations that transform an object interactilvely and
     that can be cancelled if they are not what the user want to do.

     <B=Note>: To save space the <I=current model matrix> and the
     <I=saved model matrix> are stored in the object only if they
     are not equal to the <See const=IdentityTransf2D> constant.
