   One of the most useful use of this property is when you need to
   link an object to a shape. Consider for example that you have
   a class TSurface in which you store informations like the
   reflectivity coefficent, the color for rendering, the adiacent
   surfaces and the points of the surface. The instances of this class
   are managed by the program that save them and so on. You need of
   course to draw them and manage them interactively (you may want to
   do that instead to change them through the list of points).

   The library can help you in this, bacause you can use the <See Class=TFace3D>
   shape that cames whith the library and that has a list of points and
   that is drawed and managed interactively by the various interaction tasks
   of the library. However if you naive add an instance of TFace3D and
   an instance of TSurface and link them through the ID property of TFace3D,
   you will have duplication of data and a difficult task to syncronize the
   two instances. A better approach is to store the TSurface reference into
   the Tag property and a TFace3D reference in the TSurface instance.
   After that you have to move any geometric datas from TSurface to the TFace3D.
   In our example simply use the TFace3D to store the points and normal, instead
   use the TSurface to store color and coefficients.
   In this way whenever the user modify the shape, the TSurface is automatically
   updated. If there is some data in TSurface that depends on the datas of TFace3D
   (for instance a baricentric point) you have two way to update this data:

   <LI=Derive from TFace3D a new shape with the added data>
   <LI=Put the data in TSurface and the add an event handler that will be
   used for the <See Property=TGraphicObject@OnChange> event>

   With the second solution whenever the points are moved the new
   baricentric point will be calculated.

   a way is needed to ensure that a list is not changed when it is
   in use by another thread.

   To do so the concept of <I=iterator> is used. An iterator is
   an object that is used to traverse a list of objects. When you
   ask and obtain an iterator on a list, you can access the elements
   in the list through the iterator. You cannot modify a list if you
   doesn't have an <I=exclusive iterator> that let you to modify the
   list as well as iterate it (<See Class=TExclusiveGraphicObjIterator>).

   As soon as you obtain an iterator the list cannot be modified and
   so you are ensured that it will remain the same during the iteration.
   Of course if you doen't release an iterator you cannot modify the list
   until the end of the program, so attention is needed when using an
   iterator.

   For backward compatibility some operations on the list are avaiable
   with the list itself (and these are however implemented with temporary

{: This class defines an exclusive iterator for a list of graphical objects
   (<See class=TGraphicObjList>).

   The library can use a <I=thread> to paint the drawings and so
   a way is needed to ensure that a list is not changed when it is
   in use by another thread.

   To do so the concept of <I=iterator> is used. An iterator is
   an object that is used to traverse a list of objects. When you
   ask and obtain an iterator on a list, you can access the elements
   in the list through the iterator. You cannot modify a list if you
   doesn't have an <I=exclusive iterator> that let you to modify the
   list as well as iterate it (<See Class=TExclusiveGraphicObjIterator>).

   As soon as you obtain an iterator the list cannot be modified and
   so you are ensured that it will remain the same during the iteration.
   Of course if you doen't release an iterator you cannot modify the list
   until the end of the program, so attention is needed when using an
   iterator.

   For backward compatibility some operations on the list are avaiable
   with the list itself (and these are however implemented with temporary
   iterators so using them is the better approach).

   See also <See Class=TExclusiveGraphicObjIterator> and
   <See Class=TGraphicObjList>.

   <B=Note>: To release an iterator simply free it. If you lost some
   reference to iterators (and so the list is blocked) you can unblock
   the list with the method <See Method=TGraphicObjList@RemoveAllIterators>.

   <B=Note>: An iterator cannot be created directly but only with the
   use of the methods <See Method=TGraphicObjList@GetIterator>,
   <See Method=TGraphicObjList@GetExclusiveIterator> and
   <See Method=TGraphicObjList@GetPrivilegedIterator>.

   but only assest what kind of operation are necessary for storing
   general graphic objects.

   these objects are only stored in a list that will be traversed to
   produce a draw as soon as you have defined such a viewport (see

       <See Class=TDrawing2D> >
   <LI=If you want to create 3D drawings use the control

   the abstract method to handle 2D or 3D objects.

   method to save and retrive the list of objects from a stream or
   a file (see <See=Object's Persistance@PERSISTANCE>). The use of polymorphism and
   class references made possible to add your own shape classes
   that will be considered as much the same as the native ones.

   Think about this control as a TDataSet for a Database application.

   <B=Note>: You don't need to derive from this control because the
   library has already the two controls you need to handle 2D and
   3D drawing. You may want to derive from this control to improve
   its list management or to implement ordered display lists for

       stream. Then this instance is saved in the list of objects of the
       source block.

       When a source block is loaded the objects that are contained in the
       source block are checked for recursive nesting of blocks. It is
       allowed to have a source block that use in its definition another
       source block, BUT this source block must be loaded before the
       source block that use it (this is automatically checked when you

       <See Method=TContainer2D@UpdateSourceReferences>
       (<See Method=TContainer3D@UpdateSourceReferences>) is called to
       update the references.

       If there is a block that references to a not defined source block
       a message will be showed and the source block will not be loaded.

  {: This class defines a viewport with which it is possible to render
     the contents of a CAD control. This is a visual component.

     The viewport is a 2D windows through which you can see a virtual world.
     The world is stored in a <See Class=TDrawing> control as a list (display list)
     of graphic objects. The world used here is dimension less, so this component
     is not directly usable but it defines only an abstract interface.

     Regardless the kind of world (2d, 3d or more) a viewport is always a window
     on which the world is projected. The view trasformation has two
     components:

     <LI=the first one project the world on the window plane. If the world
         is already 2D this is a simple identity transform (Projection) >
     <LI=the second one project the window plane onto a portion on the canvas
         of the control (Mapping).>

     This control defines and uses only the second component of the transformation
     (see <See Method=TCADViewport@BuildViewportTransform>). The other one is
     dimension dependent and so must be defined in derived classes.

     You manage the window position and size (that is modify the second component
     of the above transformations) using the property
     <See Property=TCADViewport@VisualRect>, that is the portion of the
     window plane that you see on the canvas of the control.
     You change the VisualRect using the zooming methods (see
     <See Method=TCADViewport@ZoomIn>, <See Method=TCADViewport@ZoomOut>,
     <See Method=TCADViewport@ZoomWindow>, <See Method=TCADViewport@ZoomToExtension>
     <See Method=TCADViewport@PanWindow> and <See Method=TCADViewport@MoveWindow>).
     All of these changes the mapping transformation (the second component explained
     above).

     A viewport use a back buffer to store the current rapresentation of the
     Drawing display list. When you start a <See Method=TCADViewport@Repaint>,
     this buffer is created and copied on the canvas of the control.
     The repaint can use a thread (painting thread) to allow the user to stop
     the operation at any time. However using a thread require some additional
     steps that require a bit of time, so it is advisable to use the thread
     (see <See Property=TCADViewport@UsePaintingThread>) only when you have
     a complex draw made up of thousand of objects.
     During the repaint process you can also copy the buffer content on the
     on screen canvas when a prestabilited number of objects (see
     <See Property=TCADViewport@CopingFrequency> property) is drawed. This
     gives a useful feedback to the user.

  {: A <I=2D graphic object> is a graphic object that is defined on
     a 2D plane.

     The 2D object is defined in a special coordinate system referred
     here as the <I=model coordinate system or model system>. When an object is used by the
     library, the world coordinate system (or world system) are
     needed instead. So the object in model system is transformed by an
     matrix transform to obtain the object in the world system.
     This transform is called the <See Property=TObject2D@ModelTransform>.
     So when an object is drawed, for example, its points are first
     transformed from model system to world system by using this matrix,
     then the view transform (that the concatenation of the
     projection matrix with the mapping matrix) tranform these points
     to obtain the points in the screen system that are easily displayed.

     The 2D object has a 2D bounding box, that is the smallest
     axis aligned rectangle that fully contains the object.
     This rectangle is always in the world coordinate system and
     so it doesn't depend on the model transform. The bounding box
     must be computed in the
     <See Property=TGraphicObject@_UpdateExtension> method that have
     to be redefined.

     The model matrix is split in two parts. The first one, called
     the <I=current model matrix>, can be removed at any time or
     can be post multiplied with a new one.

     The second one, called the <I=saved model matrix>, is stored
     permanently inside the object and can only be removed
     by using the <See Method=TObject2D@RemoveTransform> method
     or substituted with the actual model matrix with the
     <See Method=TObject2D@ApplyTransform> method.
     The actual model matrix is the concatenation of the
     <I=saved model matrix> with the <I=current model matrix> in
     this order (remember that the order of concatenation of transform matrix
     is important).

     The presence of the <I=current model matrix> is helpfull to
     create operations that transform an object interactilvely and
     that can be cancelled if they are not what the user want to do.

     the event. See <See Method=TCADState@OnEvent> for details.

     events, expose events and user events>.

     an interaction task. A state may be reused in more that one
     interaction task.

     The interaction task (from now on simply a task) evolves through
     the states in respons to <I=events>. An <I=event> is some action
     on the CADPrg or the linked Viewport performed by the user or
     by the control itself.
     A task is an <I=active state>, that is the state with receives

     events, expose events and user events>.

     The user must derives its states from this class to implement
     an interaction task. A state may be reused in more that one
