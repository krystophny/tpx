{: This help file explain all the interaction task classes defined in
   the CADSys 4.0 library for both the 2D and 3D use.

   These classes are defined in the CS4Tasks unit file
   that you must include in the <B=uses> clause in all of your units
   that access the types mentioned here.

   See also <See Class=TCADPrg><BR>

   The task classes defined here can be used in your program by
   adding a <See Class=TCADPrg> component of the desired type
   (2D or 3D) and using the following code to start a task:

   <CODE=
    ACADPrg.StartOperation(<<A task class>>, <<The required task parameter>>);
   >

   If you want to stop a task use the following code:

   <CODE=
    ACADPrg.SendUserEvent(CADPRG_CANCEL);
   >

   and to finish the current task use the code:

   <CODE=
    ACADPrg.SendUserEvent(CADPRG_ACCEPT);
   >

   You may also start another task by suspending the current
   one (if it can be suspended) with the code:

   <CODE=
    ACADPrg.SuspendOperation(<<A task class>>, <<The required task parameter>>);
   >

   <B=Note>: All the 3D tasks work on the active
   <See=working plane@WORKPLANE> of the <See Class=TCADPrg3D>.
